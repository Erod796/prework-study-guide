# <Pre-Work Study guide Webpage>

## Description

My motivation was to get a head start an intake what was given to me in the pre-work. I built this project to help me refer to something, when in need of a small reminder of the main points. The problem it solves is to avoid looking around around, when you can find it in one spot. It was a little hard to learn but im hoping throught the class it get easier.
